# MNIST-Classifier-with-Automation
MNIST dataset is used to classify images by building CNN model and increasing the accuracy by automating the architecture using Jenkins and Docker. 
Follow the steps this article to have automated your own model with just 3 Jenkins jobs.

Future scope:
1. Implement a method to add/remove Convolution layers (CRP) - Already working on it!
2. Allow complete automation through Ops without including any extra lines of developer code.
3. Devise a Jenkins distributive cluster to train heavier real-world models.
